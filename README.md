I kept everything the same as the lab except I added: self.genre and self.purchasecount and I created the function to display the genre, filter by genre, display the top 3 purchased books, search by author and title, and to save and load the purchases to a txt file and then I added a main function and put it so that it would display the genre, display and view the books that were purchased, reading the book and then reading the same book, display the top purchased books, filter by the genre, and search by the author and book title then I called the main function
